# Sayi Avatar Tools for VRChat

A selection of tools I work on to make creating avatars less annoying.

Also includes some shaders I made.

## Installation
To install them just download the zip file and just move its content into the unity project directory. All paths are relative to each other so as long as the file structure stays unchanged it will work as expected regardless of where in the project directory they are being placed.

I will not provide a unitypackage.

## Update
To update, please go to Tools > SayiTools > Update. This will open a new window which checks if a newer version is available and can install the most up to date version automatically by the press of a button.
